+ gui work, exciting stuff!!
+ /// work on the spawning logic. enemies shouldn't ideally appear on the same "row".
+ SCRAPPED: add shield powerup
+ add animations to sprites
+ /// implement the collide_circle sprite collisions
+ /// tweak values of helleye and solturret
+ /// fix the health pickup bug.
+ /// random tweaking and balancing
+ add a timed "supercharged" mode for the player's gun when gun level is 4  

+ /// idea: roll chances for the powerups / upgrades change depending on the circumstance? 
    for example, high health means there is less chance for health powerups, low gun level means there is a high chance for gun powerups...
    ...and so on.
    (4/7/2021) this was implemented, however roll chances for powerups now depend on the "stage" of the game
+ SCRAPPED: idea: maybe limit the number of sentries at any given time to n amount depending on difficulty?
    (4/7/2021) scrapped this one as it's not really a problem during actual gameplay
