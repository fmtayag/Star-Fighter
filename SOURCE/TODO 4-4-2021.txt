+ gui work, exciting stuff!!
+ /// palette recoloring
+ /// create solturret sprite
+ /// create sentry sprite
+ /// create helleye sprite
+ /// create shield sprite
+ /// add a barebones game over scene
+ /// implement difficulty selection scene
+ work on the spawning logic. enemies shouldn't ideally appear on the same "row".
+ /// problem: the roll chances for the upgrades are crap...gotta work on it somehow
+ idea: roll chances for the powerups / upgrades change depending on the circumstance? 
    for example, high health means there is less chance for health powerups, low gun level means there is a high chance for gun powerups...
    ...and so on.
+ idea: maybe limit the number of sentries at any given time to n amount depending on difficulty?
+ idea: add shield powerup
