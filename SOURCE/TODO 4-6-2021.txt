+ gui work, exciting stuff!!
+ work on the spawning logic. enemies shouldn't ideally appear on the same "row".
+ idea: roll chances for the powerups / upgrades change depending on the circumstance? 
    for example, high health means there is less chance for health powerups, low gun level means there is a high chance for gun powerups...
    ...and so on.
+ idea: maybe limit the number of sentries at any given time to n amount depending on difficulty?
+ idea: add shield powerup
+ add animations to sprites
+ /// add radius to sprites for sprite collisions
+ /// move the "end game" check outside the sprite collisions loops
+ add "halo" light around the bullets
