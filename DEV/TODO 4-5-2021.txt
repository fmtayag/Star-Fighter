+ gui work, exciting stuff!!
+ work on the spawning logic. enemies shouldn't ideally appear on the same "row".
+ idea: roll chances for the powerups / upgrades change depending on the circumstance? 
    for example, high health means there is less chance for health powerups, low gun level means there is a high chance for gun powerups...
    ...and so on.
+ idea: maybe limit the number of sentries at any given time to n amount depending on difficulty?
+ idea: add shield powerup
+ /// add images to sprites 
+ add animations to sprites
+ add radius to sprite collisions
+ /// work on sentry gun rotation
    ... this one took me 4 fuckin hours to figure out. but it works now! and its kinda crap, the way the image distorts i mean...
    ... i guess that's just how SDL rotates images...oh welp.
    ... well, i managed to make it smooth looking using the rotozoom() function. VERY NICE!!!
    ... credits to Neck Deep for fueling my resolve to...rotate an image.
